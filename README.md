# SoftwareVisualInterface
Easy to use interface for creating visual and interactive programs via javax.swing libraries. (Handles the awkward stuff to provide an easy-to-use environment)

## Check out the Wiki for a Tutorial on using this!

The goal for this library is to obscure many low-level details and give the programmer simple commands for designing their UI; check out the Finite State Machine Model project's ui package for examples on its use in more complicated projects.

If you have any questions, concerns, or recommendations for the library, please let me know! I want to make this library useful for other people as an easy way to start making programs when low-level issues usually push people away from this kind of thing. Email me at sirborinor@gmail.com or open an issue on here so I can get back to you.

I'm aware the library may be a bit dense, but hopefully through provided examples it's usage will be made clear.

Enjoy!

This is a testing ground I use for making sure elements are drawn properly, to give a visual idea of some of what it can do

Scrollbars can be added to move elements vertically and horizontally, canvases can be drawn on, animations are supported, text has some formatting options for placement within a bounded space, lots of stuff going on here.

I'm quite proud of this even as I eye that tangle of dependencies around CodeReference... always more refactoring and design to do.
